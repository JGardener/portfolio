      <h3>Wonderful Creative Agency</h3>
      <p>
        At Wonderful, I completed various projects for the agency; a quote
        template for an environmental company, an email signature for a law
        firm, and a high-profile collaboration between a household name and a
        top BBC/Netflix TV show.
      </p>
      <p>
        The collaboration required me to learn some new libraries, such as
        TinySlider and Fancybox, to complete the design. Moreover, I learned
        TailwindCSS from scratch.
